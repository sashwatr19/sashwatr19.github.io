# Portfolio

Hi! I am a Mathematics graduate who loves to use their problem-solving ability in the realms of Data Science and Machine Learning. Check out the stuff I've worked on below.

## Machine Learning Projects

[Multi-Instance Contrastive Learning (MICLe)](https://github.com/sashwatr19/sashwatr19.github.io/tree/main/Multi-Instance%20Contrastive%20Learning%20(MICLe)%20Tutorial) : I produced a novel implementation of the MICLe model, an unsupervised learning method created Azizi et al. A tutorial explains the mechanisms and the code created. TensorFlow was used to execute the model.

[Comparitive Analysis of Various Machine Learning Methods](https://github.com/sashwatr19/sashwatr19.github.io/tree/main/Comparative%20Analysis%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Methods) : I conducted a comparative analysis of KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest to examine their performance on a geographical dataset.
